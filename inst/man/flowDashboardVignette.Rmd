This document outlines how to set up a flow cytometry dashboard using the `flowDashboard` Shiny modules.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Where `flowDashboard` Fits in an Analysis Workflow

`flowDashboard` enables you to visualize data at the Sample and Population Level. The package assumes that you either have FCS data in a directory, or have generated a GatingSet for your gating scheme. This gating scheme can either be automated (from a pipeline such as `openCyto`) or manually (imported from flowJo). 

There are multiple modules that will enable you to examine each step of the analysis. 

  - `Annotation` display - displays annotation for all the FCS files in an experiment.
  - `QC` plots - plots that let you compare the overall state of the data before and after preprocessing.
  - `Gating` plots - plots that display how the data was gated
  - `Dot` plots - to visualize populations based on a covariate
  - `Violin` plots of markers in a population
  - `Waterfall` plots to examine how population percentage correlates with an outcome.
  - `Coexpression` plots - a heatmap and a two-way expression explorer.

## Preprocessing Data

Once your data is in a GatingSet (preferably in ncdf format), we will need to transform and prep it into the `data.table` format. This package uses `data.table` because it is a very fast format for accessing and displaying data.

The annotation structure is another `data.table` that we need for the dashboard. Based on your unit of analysis and what the FCS file represents (which may be patients, cell lines, or conditions within a patient), you will need an annotation table that provides covariate information at the level of analysis you are interested in. You can generate the skeleton of an annotation table.
