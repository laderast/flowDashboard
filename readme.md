# flowDashboard

Shiny modules for visualizing flow cytometry data as well as data transformation methods to enable the rapid display of cytometry data.

flowDashboard currently works with GatingSets (derived from the flowWorkspace package) into data table structures. Using CytoML, gating schemes from flowJo and Cytobank can also be imported for display.

The shiny modules are intended to address each step of an analysis workflow (preprocessing/data transformation, normalization, gating and comparative analysis).
