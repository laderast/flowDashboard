# Contributing to flowDashboard

First of all, thank you for even considering helping us out.

The best way to [contact us is through the issues tab](http://github.com/laderast/flowDashboard/issues). Open an issue and we'll try and get back to you as soon as possible.

1. `flowDashboard` is fairly experimental at this point. We are looking for developers who have data they want to deploy as a dashboard for testing. We want you to take your data, in `gatingSet` format, and transform it into the different data objects, and slot the data objects into the [sampleFlowDashboard code](https://github.com/laderast/sampleFlowDashboard).

2. Bug testing and reports are always welcome. Please open an issue!

3. We welcome new visualizations and modules that utilize our data objects as contributions/pull requests to the code.
