# Contributing to flowDashboard

First of all, thank you for even considering helping us out.

1. `flowDashboard` is fairly experimental at this point. We are looking for developers who have data they want to deploy as a dashboard for testing. We want you to take your data, in `gatingSet` format, and transform it into the different data objects. 

2. Bug testing and reports are always welcome.
